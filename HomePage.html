<h3 id="title"> Yankees Spring Training </h3>

<p id="headingline"> Welcome to the Yankees Official Website! </p>

<p class="words"> The Home of the 27 time World Series Champions, New York Yankees! </p>
<div class="words"> The Yankees head into 2017 with a bright future filled with a ton of young talent. Yankees' farm system ranks first in the eyes of many analysts, especially in the eyes of this very website, written by Joe Kurtz</div>
<div class="words"> Leading the farm system is the number three overall prospect in the whole baseball league, Gleyber Torres. Gleyber, acquired by the Yankees in the package in exchange for Aroldis Chapman, is a Venezuelan-born short stop playing for Trenton Thunder. In his time with the Yankees, Gleyber has been lighting up the stats and was even awarded AFL MVP. Also aquired in the offseason, Clint Frazier is tearing up the minor leagues. The number 24 overall prospect, Clint was aquired by the Yankees along with Justus Sheffield (#79) and Ben Heller. </div>
<p class="words"  id="babybombers"> And finally...returning, the BABY BOMBERS!! Aaron Judge, Greg Bird, and Gary Sanchez. Aaron, perhaps has as much power as Giancarlo Stanton, is returning to play right field after struggling a bit making contact. Greg Bird, after missing the entire 2016 season recovering from a shoulder surgery, is back after a very successful 2015 run. And finally the 2016 ROTY runner-up, EL Cranken, Gary Sanchez. In only 53 games, Gary hit 20 homeruns, with multiple multi homerun games. </p>
